# Futuristic Command-Line Billing System

This is a Python-based command-line billing system designed to deliver a high-tech, futuristic experience while handling basic billing tasks. It includes features like unit conversions, customer information validation, itemized billing, and optional tax calculations. The program simulates a secure server connection, displays system details, and utilizes animations for a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **System Awareness**: Displays system information (OS, processor, Python version, etc.) to simulate a secure and sophisticated environment.
- **Futuristic Loading Animations**: Connects to a simulated remote billing server with detailed loading animations, enhancing immersion.
- **Itemized Billing with Unit Conversion**: Supports billing items in various units (kg, g, liter, etc.) and converts them to a base unit for consistent pricing.
- **Customer Validation and Secure Session**: Initiates billing with validated customer information and a simulated secure session.
- **Tax Calculation**: Automatically adds tax (5% default) to the final total, with a clear itemized breakdown.
